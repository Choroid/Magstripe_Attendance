Setup
==========

All the check-in script is is a Python script. Thus, to run it just do 'python checkin.py'. One caveat: you must have the
MySQLdb Python module installed. If you do not, the script will tell you and refuse to run.

Also, you will need to change the "dbHost", "dbUser", and "dbTable" variables at the top of the script to values for your
database.

Finally, the whole script is pointless without a card reader. Since it was built for a card read that uses keyboard
emulation you could just type the card info in, but without a card reader you have no way of knowing what that
info is!


Usage
==========

Usage is very straightforward. Simply run 'python checkin.py' and follow the prompts. Enter "back" at any time to
go up a menu level.

The database fields the script expects are as follows:
"cardID" varchar, primary key
"accessID varchar
"points" int
"lastCheckin" timestamp

Make sure that your database is setup appropriately.

On the first run you will want to populate your database. The easiest way to do this is to select the "Add Card" menu
option. You can then add a single card or add multiple cards until "back" is entered to go back to the main menu.

You can also select the check-in option and if a card doesn't exist in the database you will be prompted to add it. This
is, however, slower than just uses the "Add Card" option.

After your database is populated you can use the "Show Points" option to show a single user's points or view a pretty
table of all users in descending order from most to least points.
